# Online-Book-Store-SQL
This is a SQL project :Online Book Store

This project, **"Online Bookstore,"** is a comprehensive SQL-based solution designed to manage and analyze core operations for an e-commerce platform. It demonstrates a strong understanding of database design, data manipulation, and advanced analytical querying.

I began by creating a structured relational database with three interconnected tables: **Books**, **Customers**, and **Orders**. This robust schema allows for efficient data storage and retrieval. I then populated these tables with data using SQL `COPY` commands.

The heart of the project lies in its analytical capabilities. I executed a variety of complex queries to extract valuable business insights, leveraging a diverse set of SQL functions. This included using **JOINs** to connect data across tables, **WINDOW** functions to perform complex calculations, and **COALESCE** to handle missing values gracefully. The project also utilizes **advanced queries** to identify loyal customers, find top-selling books, analyze customer spending habits, and track sales by author. Through this project, I successfully applied these key SQL concepts to transform raw data into actionable information, showcasing my ability to solve real-world business problems with SQL.
