# Online-Book-Store-SQL
This is a SQL project :Online Book Store

This project, "Online Bookstore," is a comprehensive SQL-based solution designed to manage and analyze core operations for an e-commerce platform. The project demonstrates a strong understanding of database design, data manipulation, and analytical querying.

I began by creating a structured relational database with three interconnected tables: **Books**, **Customers**, and **Orders**. This robust schema allows for efficient data storage and retrieval. I then populated these tables with data using SQL `COPY` commands.

The heart of the project lies in its analytical capabilities. I executed a variety of complex queries to extract valuable business insights. These queries included identifying loyal customers who placed multiple orders, finding the top-selling books, analyzing customer spending habits, and tracking sales by author. Through this project, I successfully applied key SQL concepts like **JOINs**, **aggregation**, and **subqueries** to transform raw data into actionable information, showcasing my ability to solve real-world business problems with SQL.
